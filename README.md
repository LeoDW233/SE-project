Purpose of the software 1.Which type of software development process is applied? Our game is applied Agile software development process.

2.Why we chose this type? Because we want to ensure the best efficiency for this software development project, streamline the process and reduce costs (e.g. time). The agile software development process allows us to respond very quickly to changes in requirements. For example, users want the game to have a new style, or to link with a certain brand. At this time, we can modify and add codes in the shortest time to meet these new requirements.What we care about is that requirement changes and user feedback can be dynamically managed and integrated into the software in a timely manner.

3.Possible usage of our software. Target market:People with fragmented breaks.(Our game doesn't require a lot of time to play, which makes short breaks entertaining for people with more fragmented breaks.)

Development process Demand stage Enter the output stage of the visualized product, discuss and provide the simplest and closest to the finished product "Product Prototype". According to the needs and project requirements, each student clarified the time points of the detailed stages, and finally carried out the "Project Task Decomposition" according to the development plan to complete the division of labor of the project.

Design phase The students provide the interface annotations, and finally according to the main interface, the students who write the code output the "Requirement Specification" in Unity

Development stage Students who write code officially enter the coding stage. Although most of the time in this process is spent writing code, functional review will be carried out after coding.

Testing phase The students who write the code modify the code according to the test results, submit the test after completion, and complete it after passing the test.

Members(roles,responsibilities,portion) Leo is responsible for implementation/design/coding/responsible for graphical abstract/development. Billy is responsible for sources/verification/design/video .Connor is responsible for implementation/design/Software development plan(Algorithm,Current status of your software,Future plan).

Schedule 4.5 Discuss everyoneâ€™s responsibilities 4.10 Students who write code roughly show their ideas for the finished product 4.11-16 Code completion 4.19 Software testing

Algorithm: Use the direction keys to control the villain left and right to prevent being held up and squeezed to death, falling to death, and being poked to death by a nail board (sharp knife).

Current status of your software: The game is written in Unity 2D and Visual Studio Code (C# language).

Future plans: The game will increase the ranking system in the future.
